# Turtle_Bot_PathPlanning

This workspace has been tested with ROS Noetic.This directory contains all the code used for A Star based Path Planning.

A Algorithm - A* (A-star) is a graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path between a start node and a goal node. It uses a combination of two cost functions: the cost to reach the current node from the start (denoted as g(n)), and an estimated cost from the current node to the goal (denoted as h(n)). The algorithm maintains a priority queue to explore nodes with the lowest total cost.
